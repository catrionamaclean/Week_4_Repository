# Week 04 - Introduction to Health Data Science

This is a markdown document which will knit to pdf.

I have created it for the week 4 exercise of Introduction to Health Data Science

It has to include 2 code chunks and some text with section headers and 2 types of list

## A Section With Some Lists

### Things I can see from where I am *sitting*

-   A calendar
-   A wicker basket
-   An ironing board
-   A small lamp

### Things I need to do this evening **in order of importance**

> 1.  Walk the dog
> 2.  Have tea
> 3.  Do a grocery shop
> 4.  Listen to an audiobook

## Some Code

A plot of pressure from an inbuilt R dataset - with the code chunk hidden.

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

The summary statistics from the cars dataset - with the code chunk included.

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Another section

Here is a further update to the R Markdown document, which I'll then upload to GitHub.

```{r}
require(graphics)
pairs(mtcars, main = "mtcars data", gap = 1/4)
coplot(mpg ~ disp | as.factor(cyl), data = mtcars,
       panel = panel.smooth, rows = 1)
## possibly more meaningful, e.g., for summary() or bivariate plots:
mtcars2 <- within(mtcars, {
   vs <- factor(vs, labels = c("V", "S"))
   am <- factor(am, labels = c("automatic", "manual"))
   cyl  <- ordered(cyl)
   gear <- ordered(gear)
   carb <- ordered(carb)
})
summary(mtcars2)
```
