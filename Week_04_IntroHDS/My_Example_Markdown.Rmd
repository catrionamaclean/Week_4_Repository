# Week 04 - Introduction to Health Data Science

This is a markdown document which will knit to pdf.

I have created it for the week 4 exercise of Introduction to Health Data Science

It has to include 2 code chunks and some text with section headers and 2 types of list


## A Section With Some Lists

### Things I can see from where I am *sitting*

-   A calendar
-   A wicker basket
-   An ironing board
-   A small lamp

### Things I need to do this evening **in order of importance**

1.  Walk the dog
2.  Have tea
3.  Do a grocery shop
4.  Listen to an audiobook

## Some Code

A plot of pressure from an inbuilt R dataset - with the code chunk hidden.

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

The summary statistics from the cars dataset - with the code chunk included.

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```
